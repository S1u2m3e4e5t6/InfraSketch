# InfraSketch: Collaborative System Design Tool

## Overview
InfraSketch is a powerful and intuitive web-based tool for designing, diagramming, and documenting system architectures. It provides a collaborative workspace where teams can create a wide variety of diagrams, including flowcharts, sequence diagrams, cloud architecture diagrams, and more. With its AI-powered features, InfraSketch accelerates the design process by automatically generating diagrams and documentation from natural language prompts.

## Key Features
- **Real-time Collaboration:** Work with your team simultaneously on the same canvas. See real-time cursors, comments, and changes.  
- **AI-Powered Diagramming:** Describe your desired architecture in plain English, and let the AI assistant generate the corresponding diagrams and documentation.  
- **Comprehensive Tools Palette:** A rich set of tools for various diagram types:  
  - Flowcharts  
  - Sequence Diagrams  
  - Entity-Relationship Diagrams (ERD)  
  - Organizational Charts  
  - Cloud Architecture (AWS, Azure, GCP)  
  - Kubernetes  
  - General Infrastructure  
- **Interactive Canvas:**  
  - Drag-and-drop interface for adding and arranging nodes.  
  - Zoom and pan for easy navigation of large diagrams.  
  - Connect nodes with lines and arrows to represent relationships.  
- **Integrated Documentation:**  
  - Built-in markdown editor to create detailed documentation alongside your diagrams.  
  - Preview your markdown documentation in real-time.  
- **Export Options:** Export diagrams and documentation to PNG, SVG, PDF.  

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend:** React, TypeScript, Vite  
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS  
- **Animation:** Framer Motion  
- **Icons:** Lucide React  
- **Collaboration & Backend:** Supabase (for real-time features)

```
.

Usage

Landing Page: Provides an overview of the application's features. Click "Start Designing" to enter the editor.

Editor Layout: Divided into three main panels:

Tools Palette (Left): Select tools and drag them onto the canvas.

Canvas (Center): Main workspace to create and arrange diagrams.

Documentation Panel (Right): Write and preview documentation in markdown. Use the AI tab to generate diagrams from prompts.

Creating a Diagram

Select a tool from the palette and click on the canvas to add a node, or drag and drop a tool onto the canvas.

Click and drag nodes to reposition them.

AI Assistant

Navigate to the AI tab in the documentation panel.

Enter a prompt describing the architecture you want (e.g., "Design a scalable e-commerce infrastructure").

The AI will generate the corresponding nodes on the canvas and provide detailed documentation.
